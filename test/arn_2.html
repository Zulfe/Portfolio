      <h1>Growing Industry Ethics</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey justified">
    <span class="italicized">Unfortunately, these principles do not outline a rational theory that can
help companies understand how to act ethically in fulfilling their obligations
to the public. Today, most court rulings are based on the premise
that the manufacturer knows more about its products than the consumer
does and therefore has a greater responsibility to make sure the products
comply with all of the manufacturer’s claims and are safe. Therefore, in
designing, manufacturing, testing, and communicating about a product,
the manufacturer has to make sure the product will be safe and effective
when used according to the instructions.</span>

      <p class="response justified">From what I've seen companies have grown in this regard, thus these problems have become less commonplace. For example, Ford and Samsung have gotten better at remedying unsafe products via mass recalls, free repairs, or free replacements. I believe a major part of this is because of the growing interconnectedness social media yields. It's easier to publicize the problems with a product and gain a following that demands reparations. Surely major corporations understand that failures will occasionally make it to the consumer, so they've invested significantly in improving the response.</p>

      <h1>Corporate Ethical Cultures vs. Personal Ethics</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
          <span class="italicized justified">According to a study by the Ethics Resource Center of more than 4,600 employees in various businesses (2012), organizations with strong ethical cultures—organizations in which ethical values are promoted at all levels and employees see that everyone lives up to the organization’s stated values—experience fewer ethical problems than organizations with weak ethical cultures. In organizations with strong ethical cultures, far fewer employees feel pressure to commit misconduct, far fewer employees observe misconduct, far more employees report the misconduct that they see, and there is far less retaliation against employees who report misconduct.</span>

      <p class="response justified">Although I appreciate the statistics-backed benefits of a corporate ethical culture, I feel that in some ways it can make a company static, undeviating, or uncreative. If a company hires only people that adhere to their canons, then ethical issues may be met with self-affirming groupthink. I'm excited to enter industry following school, but I'm worried about the potential conflict between my personal ethics and the ethics a corporation expects from or imposes on its employees.</p>

      <h1>Policy on Social Media vs. Personal Life</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey justified">
    <span class="italicized">If your employer has a written policy about how employees may use social
    media, study it. If there is no written policy, check with Human Resources or
    your supervisor for advice. If you think that you will be unable to abide by
    the employer’s policy—whether written or not—you should not work there or
    you should abide by it while you try to change it.</span>

      <p class="response justified">This note connects to my previous note in that I'm concerned how my employer's imposed set of ethics may interfere with my personal life. I understand that a company may does not want its employees representing it in a negative light via social media. However, where is the line drawn between one's life inside and outside of the workplace? Why is there not an employee right to privacy outside of the workplace? It seems like employers are more invested in a potential or current employee's private life.</p>
